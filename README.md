# Software-Defined-Sensor-Addressed-Motion-Control-Fabric
A software-defined motion control fabric that decouples control algorithms from physical actuators, enabling hardware reuse across multiple PLCs and machines through sensor-addressed power multiplexing over Ethernet. This project is based on patented technology and covered by one or more issued or pending patents.
